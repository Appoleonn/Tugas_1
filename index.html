                Once upon a time, there lived a beautiful woman named Dayang Sumbi.<p>
                She lived deep in the forest with her dog named Si Tumang and his son named Sangkuriang.<p>
                One day, Dayang Sumbi asked Sangkuriang to hunt a deer with Tumang.<p>
                However, Sangkuriang did not manage to get one, so he decided to kill Tumang and bring his heart to his mother.<p>
                Dayang Sumbi, who knew about it, was angry and kicked Sangkuriang out of the house.<p
                Several years later, Sangkuriang accidentally met Dayang Sumbi and fell in love, not knowing that she was his mother.<p>
                Dayang Sumbi, who knew that the man was her son, refused Sangkuriang's proposal.<p>
                She then asked a very tough conditions, which were to dam the Citarum river and build a big boat in the middle of the dam.<p>
                Because it did not finish on time, Sangkuriang got angry and kicked the boat and it became Mount Tangkuban Prau.
